## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for every programmer, as they form the backbone of efficient and scalable software solutions. This repository aims to provide clear explanations and practical implementations of these concepts in Java.

## Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Basic array operations and algorithms.
2. **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: Stack data structure with various operations.
4. **Queues**: Implementation of different types of queues.
5. **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.
6. **Graphs**: Graph representations and traversal algorithms.
7. **Heaps**: Min and max heaps and their applications.
8. **Hash Tables**: Hash table implementation and collision resolution techniques.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, etc.
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: Examples of dynamic programming problems and solutions.
5. **Greedy Algorithms**: Greedy approach and related algorithms.
